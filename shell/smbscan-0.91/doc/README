tiny readme for smbscan script by kon
license: GNU http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
provided as is, its not the script that may do harm, its always the user of the script
think before you act :P
 
TODO:
it does work, more or less, but could be more comfortable
supports smb (server message block) 
prolly nbt (netbios over tcp) when using correct port (137-139 instead of 445)

tools needed:

smbclient \
           }- these should come together with 'smbfs' 
smbmount  / 

netcat (nc) - the TCP/IP swiss army knife 

python2.3 (optional...) - i know there IS a better way to handle the dates, i just dont know IT

and some others... you'll certainly find out yourself what is missing :P

usage:
./smbscn start.ip-end.ip ,eg: ./smbscn 172.10.10.0-172.10.20.255

what it does:
it scans every IP of the given range and checks if microsoft-ds (tcp 445) is open.
then it mounts every available share and gets it's content.

see ./log/$date_of_scan/FS.log for a complete list to easily grep after files/extensions (yummy!)
see ./mnt/$date_of_scan_/$IP for all mounted shares

./umountshares unmounts all shares (oh, really?!) 
  -> you might need umount in your sudoers file with NOPASSWD set to prevent annoyance
./cleanlogs removes all folders and files created while scanning
