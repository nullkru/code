Description:

  Autoftp is a program that can retrieve, send, or list files via
  the FTP protocol in a non-interactive manner.

Requirements:

  This program requires Perl 5.004 or higher.  Also required are
  the following Perl modules:

	libnet		(v1.0606 or higher, located at a CPAN near you)

  CPAN can be found at "http://www.cpan.org/".


Installation:

  This program has only been tested on a Solaris systems (running 2.6 and 8).
  I don't believe there is anything that would prevent it from working with
  any other version of Unix.

  Change the first line in "autoftp" to reflect where Perl is installed
  on your system.

  Copy the autoftp program to your favorite bin directory (i.e. /usr/local/bin).

  Copy the man page to your favorite manl directory and rename it as
  appropriate for that directory (i.e. /usr/local/man/manl/autoftp.l)


Bugs/Additions:

  I would appreciate knowing about any bugs either found or
  fixed and any enhancements made.  I would like to keep a
  centralized version with the upgrades so that there aren't
  50 million different versions.  I can't make any
  guarantees to when bug fixes would be made (if any are
  found :-{), but I'll do my best.

  I hope this program is of use to you, either in it's capacity or as
  an example in Perl programming.
